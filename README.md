# Typetorch

Typetorch is an experimental C++26 project for type-safe LibTorch tensor wrappers
and lightweight Python C API bindings.

The core wrapper carries tensor shape, dtype, device, and layout information in
C++ types while forwarding runtime work to LibTorch. LibTorch still owns tensor
storage, kernels, dispatch, autograd, and device behavior; Typetorch adds a typed
contract layer around `at::Tensor`.

## Status

This repository is a research/prototype codebase. It intentionally depends on
very recent C++ compiler features, especially C++26 modules and static
reflection. Expect toolchain sensitivity.

## Requirements

Minimum practical requirements:

| Component | Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C++ compiler | GCC 16.1 or newer with modules and static reflection support | Older GCC releases are not expected to build this project. |
| Build system | xmake | Used for C++26 module builds and local package resolution. |
| LibTorch | 2.8.0 + CUDA 12.8 archive | The repository includes an xmake package recipe in `packages/l/libtorch-bin/`. |
| Python headers | CPython development headers | Required for `typetorch_capi_ext`. |
| Python runtime | Python with `torch` installed | Required only to import and exercise the extension. |
| OS/tooling | Linux, `nm`, `size`, common binutils | Measurement scripts assume Unix-like tooling. |

The repository does not hard-code a machine layout. If GCC or xmake is not on
`PATH`, set these optional variables before sourcing `scripts/env.sh`:

```bash
export GCC_ROOT=/path/to/gcc-16.1-or-newer
export GCC_RUNTIME_LIB=/path/to/gcc/runtime/lib64   # optional
export XMAKE_ROOT=/path/to/xmake-prefix             # optional
export PYTHON=/path/to/python                       # optional
```

## Build From Scratch

Clone and initialize submodules:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> typetorch
cd typetorch
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Prepare the environment:

```bash
source scripts/env.sh
bash scripts/check_env.sh
```

Configure and run the tensor API test:

```bash
xmake f -m debug --yes --python="${PYTHON:-python3}"
xmake build typetorch_tensor_arithmetic_test
xmake run typetorch_tensor_arithmetic_test
```

Build and run the C++ debug example:

```bash
xmake build typetorch_cpp_debug
xmake run typetorch_cpp_debug
```

Build the Python extension:

```bash
xmake build typetorch_capi_ext
```

The extension is emitted under `build/<platform>/<arch>/<mode>/` with basename
`typetorch_capi`.

For release measurements:

```bash
xmake f -m release --yes --python="${PYTHON:-python3}"
xmake build typetorch_forwarding_benchmark
xmake build binary_size_libtorch_probe
xmake build binary_size_tensor_probe
```

## API Sketch

```cpp
import typetorch;

using Matrix = typetorch::Tensor<
    typetorch::Shape<2, 3>,
    typetorch::DType::F32,
    typetorch::Device::CPU,
    typetorch::Layout::Contiguous>;

at::Tensor raw = at::arange(6, options).view({2, 3});
auto typed = Matrix::retain(raw);        // runtime contract check
auto flat = typed.flatten<>();           // result type is Shape<6>
at::Tensor back = std::move(flat).unwrap();
```

Important differences from ordinary LibTorch code:

| Topic | LibTorch | Typetorch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tensor type | Mostly dynamic `at::Tensor` metadata | Shape, dtype, device, and layout are part of the C++ type. |
| Shape errors | Usually runtime errors | Statically known shape mismatches fail during compilation. |
| Dynamic dimensions | Tensor sizes are runtime values | `dyn` marks dimensions that remain runtime-checked. |
| Ownership style | `at::Tensor` is copyable handle type | `Tensor<...>` is move-only; use `unwrap()` to recover raw LibTorch. |
| Trust boundary | Any `at::Tensor` can flow anywhere | `retain()` validates raw tensors before they enter typed code. |
| Layout | Runtime property | `Layout::Contiguous`, `Layout::NonContiguous`, or `Layout::Any` can be tracked. |

See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md) for the supported operation style and the places
where Typetorch intentionally differs from LibTorch.

## Current Measurement Snapshot

These numbers are a snapshot from the `Tensor`-only wrapper layout after
removing the former `TensorBase` layer. Reproduce them with the commands in
[docs/performance-and-size.md](docs/performance-and-size.md). Treat them as
indicative, not as a stable benchmark promise.

### Forwarding Performance

Release build, CPU tensors, 1 thread, 1000 iterations. Ratio is
`Typetorch / raw at::Tensor`; values near 1.0 mean no measurable forwarding loss.

| Operation | Raw ns/op | Typetorch ns/op | Ratio | Overhead |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `add.dynamic` | 1984.773 | 1977.399 | 0.9963 | -0.37% |
| `add.static` | 2008.366 | 1990.744 | 0.9912 | -0.88% |
| `matmul.static` | 12711.788 | 12760.018 | 1.0038 | +0.38% |
| `transpose.static` | 994.180 | 998.066 | 1.0039 | +0.39% |
| `view.static` | 748.612 | 745.286 | 0.9956 | -0.44% |
| `permute.static` | 1125.074 | 1112.860 | 0.9891 | -1.09% |

### Symbol Growth Probe

Debug/no-inline `binary_size_libtorch_probe` and `binary_size_tensor_probe`,
summarized with `scripts/nm_size_probe.sh debug`. Both probes print `16` and run
the same high-level retain/add/unwrap/numel flow; the first uses only native
`at::Tensor`, while the second routes the typed paths through Typetorch.

| Symbol group | Bytes | Symbols | Interpretation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Native probe functions | 486 | 9 | Native `at::Tensor` equivalent helper functions. |
| Typed probe functions | 768 | 9 | Typetorch helper functions with the same call flow. |
| Typed/native probe function ratio | 1.580x | - | +282 bytes in the noinline helper layer. |
| Tensor wrapper nm records | 432 | 7 | `Tensor` wrapper records, including ABI alias records. |
| Tensor wrapper unique code addresses | 321 | 4 | Same wrapper set folded by address; this is the better code-entity count. |
| Runtime check symbols | 700 | 5 | Runtime shape/dtype/device/layout contract checks. |

### Binary Size Snapshot

| Target | Mode | File size | `.text` | `.data` | `.bss` | `size` total |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `typetorch_forwarding_benchmark` | release | 51 KiB | 43,157 | 1,480 | 200 | 44,837 |
| `binary_size_libtorch_probe` | release | 59 KiB | 48,394 | 1,376 | 200 | 49,970 |
| `binary_size_tensor_probe` | release | 63 KiB | 49,659 | 1,400 | 200 | 51,259 |
| `typetorch_tensor_arithmetic_test` | release | 83 KiB | 72,948 | 1,672 | 200 | 74,820 |
| `binary_size_libtorch_probe` | debug | 3.9 MiB | 156,908 | 1,272 | 200 | 158,380 |
| `binary_size_tensor_probe` | debug | 6.2 MiB | 210,713 | 1,320 | 200 | 212,233 |

Compared to the native LibTorch probe, the typed Typetorch probe is 4,120 file
bytes and 1,265 `.text` bytes larger in release mode, or about +6.9% file size
and +2.6% `.text`.
